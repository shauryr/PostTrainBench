# Rerun Judge Pipeline

Reruns the disallowed usage judge on existing result directories. The judge analyzes `solve_trace.txt` by starting from the end and tracing back where `final_model` comes from.

## Architecture

The rerun functionality is integrated into the main judge:
- `../prompt.txt` contains trace analysis instructions
- `../get_judge_prompt.py` generates prompts with trace support
- `../run_judge.sh` is the unified script for running/rerunning the judge

This directory contains orchestration scripts for batch reruns.

## Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `utils.py` | Shared utilities for directory listing and parsing |
| `list_results.py` | List and filter result directories |
| `aggregate_rerun_results.py` | Aggregate and compare results |
| `rerun_single.sh` | Run judge on a single result directory (wrapper for `run_judge.sh --rerun`) |
| `commit_rerun_judge.sh` | Submit HTCondor jobs |
| `rerun_judge.sub` | HTCondor submission file |

## Usage

### Run judge on a single directory

```bash
# Run judge (overwrites existing judgements)
bash src/disallowed_usage_judge/run_judge.sh /path/to/result_dir

# Rerun judge (saves with _rerun suffix, preserves originals)
bash src/disallowed_usage_judge/run_judge.sh --rerun /path/to/result_dir

# Or use the wrapper script
bash src/disallowed_usage_judge/rerun_judge/rerun_single.sh /path/to/result_dir
```

### Submit HTCondor jobs

```bash
# Submit jobs for all result directories
./src/disallowed_usage_judge/rerun_judge/commit_rerun_judge.sh

# Filter by method
./src/disallowed_usage_judge/rerun_judge/commit_rerun_judge.sh --method "claude"

# Filter by benchmark
./src/disallowed_usage_judge/rerun_judge/commit_rerun_judge.sh --benchmark "aime"

# Skip directories that already have rerun judgements
./src/disallowed_usage_judge/rerun_judge/commit_rerun_judge.sh --skip-existing

# Limit to first 10 directories
./src/disallowed_usage_judge/rerun_judge/commit_rerun_judge.sh --limit 10
```

### List and filter results

```bash
# List all directories
python src/disallowed_usage_judge/rerun_judge/list_results.py

# Show trace file info
python src/disallowed_usage_judge/rerun_judge/list_results.py --with-trace

# List directories missing rerun judgement
python src/disallowed_usage_judge/rerun_judge/list_results.py --missing-rerun

# Get just paths (for piping)
python src/disallowed_usage_judge/rerun_judge/list_results.py --paths-only --method "claude"
```

### Aggregate results

```bash
# Show summary
python src/disallowed_usage_judge/rerun_judge/aggregate_rerun_results.py

# Only show changed judgements
python src/disallowed_usage_judge/rerun_judge/aggregate_rerun_results.py --diff-only

# Export to CSV
python src/disallowed_usage_judge/rerun_judge/aggregate_rerun_results.py --csv results.csv
```

## Output Files

When running with `--rerun` flag, new files are created in each result directory (originals preserved):
- `contamination_judgement_rerun.txt`
- `disallowed_model_judgement_rerun.txt`
- `judge_output_rerun.json`

When running without `--rerun`, the original files are overwritten:
- `contamination_judgement.txt`
- `disallowed_model_judgement.txt`
- `judge_output.json`

## Trace File

The judge expects `solve_parsed.txt` in the result directory. It copies this to the parent of the task directory (accessible as `../solve_parsed.txt` from the judge's working directory).
